# News!

* April 14, 2018: A `new post` is out - [How many laters do you need?](https://naftalic.github.io//posts/2018/04/layers/) Look at the following labeled data and think, using a neural network, what is the minimum number of neurons and layers that are needed to classify the training examples correctly? In this post, I will explore this problem and demonstrate the solution using Keras. Only `15 minute read!` <img src='/images/output_19_0_2.png'><img src='/images/output_27_0_2.png'>

* April 10, 2018: My `first post` on [classifying grayscale images of handwritten digits (MNIST) using Keras](https://naftalic.github.io//posts/2018/04/mnist_keras/) is out. It is `only 7 min read!` <img src='/images/output1_4_0.png'><img src='/images/output1_20_0.png'>

* I maintain a Facebook group named: [`Puzzles lovers group`](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1462065760548710/?ref=bookmarks). It's in Hebrew, and you are welcome to join!

* I am a professional Rubikâ€™s cube solver and, in my free time, I focus on developing non-memorization techniques to solve the cube. [`Here`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJyTOw7CNt_6JIielrbvACfyHGjxmcWv_) is a couple of YouTube videos (in Hebrew) showing my explanation for solving the 3x3x3 cube without any algorithms or learning by heart.

* My academic research focuses on the stochasticity and predictability of high-impact storms and the climate system. [`Here`](https://naftalic.github.io/academic_research/) you can read a bit about my published and peer-reviewed work.
