Short Bio
======
I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Math from the Courant Institute at NYU, graduating in 2014. 
Currently, I work as a Data Scientist in the Intelligent Solutions group at JPMorgan Chase, focusing on Big-Data analytics, AI strategies, Statistical learning, and Predictive Modeling. 
Previously, I worked as a data scientist and researcher at Yale and Columbia University concentrating on the stochasticity and predictability of high-impact storms and the climate system. 
I have vast experience in designing algorithms, performing numerical simulations and applying statistical learning to real-world data, and have published my work in more than ten peer-reviewed papers. I am also an alumnus of The Data Incubator.
